# Introduction

Working on a lot of non-standardized media server features like WebRTC simulcast or HLS to WebRTC conversion, 
we got priceless knowledge and experience.
In a lot of cases, to make something work we had to dive into an extremely complex code.
Many times we reached the ends of the Internet.

This book is an effort to collect everything we learned, read, discovered or invented both for us - developers of Jellyfish media server and for you - little travelers willing to create your own media server.

Happy reading!
