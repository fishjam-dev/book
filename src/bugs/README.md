# The Great Chapter of Bugs

During the development of Jellyfish, we encountered a wide variety of bugs which solving sometimes took us
days or weeks.
This chapter collects the most interesting ones, explaining where was the problem and how we solved it.
We hope that you will find here things that we couldn't find anywhere.
