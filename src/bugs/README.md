# The Great Chapter of Bugs

During the development of Jellyfish, we encountered a wide variety of bugs that took days, weeks or even
months to solve.
This chapter collects the most interesting ones, explaining where was the problem and how we solved it.
We hope that you will find here things that we couldn't find anywhere.
