# The Great Chapter of Bugs

During the development of Jellyfish, we encountered a wide variety of bugs that took us days, weeks or even
months to fix.
This chapter contains the most interesting cases, explains what the roots of the problems were and how we solved them. 
We hope that in this chapter you will find information that we couldn't find anywhere.
